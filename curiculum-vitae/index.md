I use TypeScript to create web interfaces and keep an eye on code complexity. I can also build simple Python or Node.js backends.

<!-- slide vertical=true-->
Processes are also significant to me: I advocate agile methodologies and extreme programming. I lead sprints, set goals, break down tasks, and formalize them.

<!-- slide vertical=true-->
I would like to work as a leader or engineering manager in a team.
